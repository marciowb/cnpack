How to add a translation for CnWizards?
---------------------------------------
CnWizards supports multi-language UI. If you want to add a new translation
for CnWizards, please do follow steps:

1. You can get all language files from our SVN or download page.
* How to access our SVN: 
http://code.google.com/p/cnpack/source/checkout
* Or you can download CnWizards source code from: 
http://code.google.com/p/cnpack/downloads/list

2. Our language files are in cnwizards\Bin\Lang, 1033 is English.
Also the Lang directory is in our installation destination, such as 
C:\Program Files\CnPack\CnWizards\Lang

3. For a new language, such as Spanish, you can copy 1033 directory to 1034 
and translate all the txt files in it into Spanish.

4. For example, if there's a line in CnWizards.txt
TCnWizAboutForm.Caption=About CnPack IDE Wizards
You can translate it as:
TCnWizAboutForm.Caption=(Translated text)

5. You can edit follow basic information in every language file. Such as:
!LanguageID=1034
!LanguageName=Spanish
!TranslationAuthor=Your Name
!TranslationAuthorEmail=Your email

6. You can copy new language directory to Lang directory in CnWizards 
installation destination. So you can see and select the new language in IDE.

7. You also need to translate follow files to new language for installer:
cnwizards\License.enu.txt
cnwizards\Readme.enu.txt
cnwizards\Install\Src\Lang\CnWizInst_enu.nsh

8. You need to translate about 4,000 lines text. When you finish, please 
mail them to master@cnpack.org. You'll see the new language in next build.
